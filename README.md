## 3rd Year - 1st Semester

### Brief description:

The project involved developing a control system-based application centered around the theme of energy optimization. The main goal was to minimize energy expenditure while maintaining performance in a simulated environment. This required tuning key parameters, such as the responsiveness variable k, determining effective strategies for transitioning between energy zones, and optimizing the classification performance of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model.

The system's design was guided by systematic testing and analysis, where various configurations were evaluated using scripts to identify optimal values for parameters like ùëò and ùêæ in KNN. The results informed a strategy for managing transitions between zones to balance energy consumption and data collection. The project also leveraged datasets constructed through targeted sampling, emphasizing energy-efficient transitions.

Overall, the project challenged the team to explore control systems and machine learning concepts, offering insights into balancing computational efficiency and performance in energy-critical contexts.
